   Example 2: `justify-between` with More Than Two Groups (Gotcha)
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-2">
   This example demonstrates the "Gotcha": if you have more than two direct child elements (or groups) in a `flex justify-between` container, it spaces out the outermost groups to the edges, and the items in between are distributed.

    Scenario: Three direct child items
   </h3>
   <div class="flex justify-between items-center bg-green-500 text-white p-4 rounded-md">
    <div class="bg-green-700 p-2 rounded">
     Item 1 (Far Left)

    <div class="bg-green-700 p-2 rounded">
     Item 2 (Middle)

            GOTCHA DEMONSTRATION:
            With `justify-between` and three direct children:
            - "Item 1" is pushed to the very left.
            - "Item 3" is pushed to the very right.
            - "Item 2" is placed in the center of the remaining space.
            This might not be what you want if you intended Item 1 and Item 2 to be grouped left, and Item 3 right.

    Explanation of the Gotcha:
   </h3>
   <p>
    `justify-between` distributes space *between* items. The first item aligns to the start, the last item to the end, and any remaining items are distributed evenly in the space between them.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you need more complex grouping (e.g., two items on the left, one on the right), you'll need to either group the items on the left into a single flex child (nested flex) or use margin utilities like `ml-auto` (see next example).

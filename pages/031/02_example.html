    Rounded Corners: Parent vs. Child Gotcha

    <strong>
     Gotcha:
    </strong>
    Applying
    <code>
     rounded-*
    </code>
    to a parent container doesn't automatically round the corners of its child elements if they fill the parent (like an image). You might need
    <code>
     overflow-hidden
    </code>
    on the parent, or also apply
    <code>
     rounded-*
    </code>
    to the child.

      1. Incorrect: Parent Rounded, Child Fills
     </h3>
     <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
      Parent has
      <code>
       rounded-lg
      </code>
      . Child image fills parent. Notice the image corners are sharp and poke out.
     </p>
     <div class="w-full h-48 bg-blue-200 rounded-lg">
      <!-- The parent div has rounded corners, but the child image does not inherit this clipping. -->
      <img alt="Image with sharp corners" class="w-full h-full object-cover" src="https://placehold.co/300x200/0ea5e9/ffffff?text=Sharp+Child"/>
     </div>
     <!-- HTML Comment: 
                    Here, the outer div .bg-blue-200 has .rounded-lg.
                    However, the inner <img> fills this div completely.
                    The image's own corners are not rounded, and they "escape" the parent's rounding.
                    This is the "Gotcha".

    <div class="bg-white p-4 shadow-md border border-green-300">
     <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-green-700">
      2. Corrected:
      <code>
       overflow-hidden
      </code>
      on Parent

     <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
      Parent has
      <code>
       rounded-lg
      </code>
      and
      <code>
       overflow-hidden
      </code>
      . The child image's corners are now clipped by the parent.

     <div class="w-full h-48 bg-teal-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
      <!-- By adding overflow-hidden to the parent, any content (like the image corners)

     <!-- HTML Comment:
                    Solution 1: Add `overflow-hidden` to the parent container (`.bg-teal-200`).
                    This clips any content of the child (`<img>`) that extends beyond the parent's rounded boundaries.
                    The image now appears to have rounded corners because its sharp edges are hidden.

      3. Corrected:
      <code>
       rounded-lg

      on Child

     <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">
      Parent has

     <div class="w-full h-48 bg-purple-200 rounded-lg p-0">
      <!-- Parent div is rounded. The image child is also explicitly rounded. -->
      <!-- For this demo, parent has p-0 to make child rounding align perfectly with parent visual edge.

      <img alt="Image with its own rounded corners" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded-lg" src="https://placehold.co/300x200/8b5cf6/ffffff?text=Rounded+Child"/>
     </div>
     <!-- HTML Comment:
                    Solution 2: Apply the rounding utility directly to the child element (`<img>`).
                    Here, the `<img>` tag itself has `rounded-lg`.
                    This is often the preferred method if you want the child element to truly be rounded,
                    rather than just appearing so due to clipping.
                    Note: If the parent had padding, the child's rounding would be relative to its own box, inside the padding.
                    For this example, parent padding is removed (p-0) to show direct alignment.

    <!-- HTML Comment:
                This shows an image with `rounded-lg` inside a parent that also has `rounded-lg` AND `p-4` (padding).
                The image corners are rounded, and this rounding occurs *within* the padded area of the parent.
                Both parent and child are technically rounded.

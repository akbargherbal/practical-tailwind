   Example 2: The `h-full` Gotcha
  </h1>
  <p class="mb-4">
   This example demonstrates the common pitfall with `h-full`: it only works if the direct parent has a defined height.

  <!-- Section 1: Gotcha - h-full not working -->
  <div class="mb-8">
   <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
    Scenario 1: `h-full` on Child, Parent Height is Auto (Gotcha)
   </h2>
   <p class="text-sm mb-2">
    The red child below has `h-full`. However, its gray parent has no explicit height (its height is determined by its content). Thus, the child's `h-full` does not make it stretch.
   </p>
   <!-- Parent with no defined height (height is auto) -->
   <div class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded shadow mb-2" style="min-height: 50px;">
    <!-- Added min-height to parent for visual clarity only. It doesn't define height for h-full context -->
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1">
     Parent (height: auto)
    </p>
    <!-- 
                GOTCHA DEMONSTRATION:
                This child has h-full, but its parent's height relies on content.
                So, h-full here will only make the child as tall as its own content, not the parent's apparent height.
                If this child had no content, it would collapse to 0 height.
            -->
    <div class="h-full bg-red-500 text-white p-2 rounded">
     Child with `h-full` (appears small as parent has no fixed height for `h-full` to inherit from)
     <br/>
     Content inside child.

   <p class="text-xs italic text-gray-600">
    Notice the red child does not fill the gray parent vertically, even though it has `h-full`.

    Scenario 2: `h-full` on Child, Parent Has Defined Height (Corrected)
   </h2>
   <p class="text-sm mb-2">
    The green child below also has `h-full`. This time, its gray parent has a defined height (`h-48`). Now, the child's `h-full` works as expected.

   <div class="h-48 bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded shadow">
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-1">

     Child with `h-full` (fills parent)

   <p class="text-xs italic text-gray-600">
    Here, the green child correctly fills its parent vertically.

   <h2 class="font-semibold">
    Gotcha Explanation:
   </h2>
   <p>
    The class `h-full` sets an element's height to 100% of its parent's height. If the parent element does not have an explicitly defined height (e.g., using Tailwind's `h-*` utilities like `h-48`, `h-screen`, or CSS `height: value;`), then `h-full` on the child will not have the desired effect of stretching it, because "100% of an undefined height" is itself undefined or based on the child's own content.

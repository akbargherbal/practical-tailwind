   Understanding the "Gotcha": Parent Height for Vertical Centering
  </h1>
  <p class="text-center text-gray-700 mb-8">
   The classes `flex items-center justify-center` are used for centering.
        `justify-center` handles horizontal centering.
        `items-center` handles vertical centering.
        The "Gotcha" is that `items-center` needs the parent container to have a defined height for vertical centering to work as expected.

  <!-- Section 1: Demonstrating the "Gotcha" -->

    Gotcha: Parent Without Defined Height
   </h2>
   <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
    In this example, the orange parent container below does
    <strong>
     not
    </strong>
    have an explicit height (e.g., `h-32`). 
            Its height is determined solely by its content.
            Therefore, `items-center` will vertically align the child within that content-derived height, which might not look "centered" if you expect it to fill a larger implicit space.
   </p>
   <div class="w-full bg-orange-200 flex items-center justify-center p-4 rounded">
    <!-- Parent container: No explicit height. 'items-center' centers within content height. -->
    <div class="p-4 bg-orange-500 text-white rounded shadow-md">
     Child Item
    </div>
    <!-- HTML Comment explaining the gotcha in context -->
    <!-- 
                GOTCHA DEMONSTRATION:
                The parent div above (bg-orange-200) has 'flex items-center justify-center'.
                However, it does NOT have a specific height class like 'h-32' or 'min-h-screen'.
                So, 'items-center' works, but it centers the 'Child Item' within the natural height of the parent, 
                which is just enough to fit the 'Child Item' plus its own padding.
                The child IS vertically centered within its parent, but the parent itself isn't tall.
            -->
   </div>
   <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
    Notice how the "Child Item" is horizontally centered, but it appears at the top of any conceptual larger vertical space because the parent `div` (bg-orange-200) only grew tall enough to contain its child plus its own padding.
   </p>
  </div>
  <!-- Section 2: Corrected - Parent with Defined Height -->
  <div class="mb-8 p-6 border border-green-400 rounded-lg bg-green-50">
   <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-green-700">
    Corrected: Parent With Defined Height
   </h2>
   <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
    Here, the teal parent container has an explicit height class (`h-48`).
            Now, `items-center` can correctly vertically center the child within this defined 48-unit height.
   </p>
   <div class="w-full h-48 bg-teal-200 flex items-center justify-center p-4 rounded">
    <!-- Parent container: Explicit height 'h-48' allows proper vertical centering. -->
    <div class="p-4 bg-teal-500 text-white rounded shadow-md">
     Centered Child
    </div>
    <!-- HTML Comment explaining the correction -->
    <!-- 
                CORRECTED APPROACH:
                By adding 'h-48' to this parent div (bg-teal-200), we give it a specific height.
                Now, 'items-center' has a defined vertical space to work with, and the 'Centered Child'
                is properly centered both horizontally and vertically within this 48-unit tall parent.
            -->
   </div>
   <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
    The "Centered Child" is now perfectly centered both horizontally and vertically within its parent because the parent has a defined height (`h-48`).
   </p>
  </div>
